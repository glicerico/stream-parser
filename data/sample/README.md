Very simple corpus, used to show the way to run the stream-parser.

`sample.vocab` is the vocabulary obtained from the `corpus` files.
It was generated by [src/scripts/dictionary_dir.sh](https://github.com/glicerico/stream-parser/src/scripts/dictionary_dir.sh)

`matrix.score` contains word-pair PMI values obtained after observing the `corpus` with `winObserve=6`.
The words are coded with indexes from `sample.vocab`.

`corpus` contains 5 sentences divided in 2 files

`parses` contains the parses of those 5 sentences.
Notice that the first sentence in the second file has no parse, because its words are not in the vocabulary.

`parses.stat` shows results after comparing the obtained parses against themselves using
SingularityNet's [parse-evaluator](https://github.com/singnet/language-learning), which is
invoked through the 
[src/scripts/stream_evaluate.sh](https://github.com/glicerico/stream-parser/src/scripts/stream_evaluate.sh) script.
Note: parse-evaluator currently has a bug that assigns zero score to a parse whose reference parse has no links, that's
why the scores in `parses.stat` are 0.8 even if comparing against itself.
